# ScreenRotator+
Small applet assembles screen rotator and other useful switches for the tablet mode of Ubuntu/Mint Linux.
It is an enhancement of the project https://github.com/frecel/ScreenRotator, 
modified and tested on Thinkpad X1 Yoga with Linux Mint 19.3 (kernel 5.0.0-32), Cinnamon 64-Bit.
It should work for other laptops with the Wacom screen and stylus.

ScreenRotator requires python3-gi to work. You can install it by running:
```
sudo apt install python3-gi
```

Screen brightness adjustment relies on xbacklight. You can install it by running: 
```
sudo apt install xbacklight
```

Switches of Trackpoint or TouchScreen will not appear if your laptop do not have corresponding devices.

The icon is from Google's Material Desing icon pack (https://materialdesignicons.com/)
